Post-processing
---------------

The raw data generated by a Struphy run is stored in the folder ``<sim_name>/`` 
(passed with ``-o <sim_name>`` to the run command), 
relative to the output path at the time of the simulation.

The basic command for Struphy post-processing is::

    struphy pproc -d <sim_name> 

Here, ``<sim_name>`` is relative to the current output path. 
In the latter, the generated output data can be inspected at:: 
    
    cd <sim_name>/post_processing/

Struphy post-processing does several things:

* save the time grid as a numpy array under ``t_grid.npy``
* evaluate FEEC fields at the grid points (or a refined grid, with the option ``--celldivide N``)
* save the evaluation grids in physical and logical space
* generate ``.vtk`` files for use in :ref:`paraview`
* compute marker trajectories in physical (x, y, z) coordinates, saved as ``.npy`` and ``.txt`` (for use in :ref:`paraview`)
* save histograms of the distribution function is phase space.
