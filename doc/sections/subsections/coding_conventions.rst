Struphy coding conventions
--------------------------

1. Struphy follows the `Python PEP 8 style guide <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_.
If you use VScode, the format conventions can be automatically applied by choosing "format document"
after right-click on the source.

2. Every class and functions must have a docstring that explains its functionalty.
Struphy uses numpy-style docstrings with "Parameters", "Returns" and "Note" keywords.
