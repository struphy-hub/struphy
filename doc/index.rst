Struphy is open-source (https://pypi.org/project/struphy/) and can be :ref:`installed on any architecture <install>`.

The package is designed for the efficient solution of partial differential equations based
on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) and particle-in-cell (PIC) methods.

Struphy can be improved by you. The repository lies on the Gitlab instance of Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF) 
(https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/struphy/struphy).

To become a developer, you need an MPCDF Gitlab account. In case you are not affiliated with the Max Planck Society, 
please :ref:`contact` a Max Planck employee for an invitation.
For further information on forking and merge- (or pull-) requests please go to :ref:`git_workflow`.
