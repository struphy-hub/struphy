Struphy is open-source (https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/struphy/struphy) and can be :ref:`installed on any architecture <install>`.

The package is designed for the efficient solution of partial differential equations based
on :ref:`geomFE` and :ref:`particle_discrete`.

Struphy features a :ref:`growing list of PDE models <models>` 
which can be solved on a variety of `mapped domains <https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/STUBDIR/struphy.geometry.domains.html>`_.

| Struphy can be improved by you (see :ref:`developers`).
| To become a developer, you need a Max-Planck Gitlab (https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/) account. 
| In case you are not affiliated with the Max Planck Society, please :ref:`contact` a Max Planck employee for an invitation.
| For further information on forking and merge- (or pull-) requests please go to :ref:`git_workflow`.
