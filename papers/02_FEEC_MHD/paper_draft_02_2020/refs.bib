	abstract = "We applied two numerical methods both belonging to the class of finite element particle-in-cell methods to a four-dimensional (one dimension in real space and three dimensions in velocity space) hybrid plasma model for electrons in a stationary, neutralizing background of ions. Here, the term hybrid means that (energetic) electrons with velocities close to the phase velocities of the model's characteristic waves are treated kinetically, whereas electrons that are much slower than the phase velocity are treated with fluid equations. The two developed numerical schemes are based on standard finite elements on the one hand and on structure-preserving geometric finite elements on the other hand. We tested and compared the schemes in the linear and in the nonlinear stage. We show that the structure-preserving algorithm leads to better results in both stages. This can be related to the fact that the spatial discretization results in a large system of ordinary differential equations that exhibits a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. To such systems special time integration schemes with good conservation properties can be applied.",

@article{Shadwick2013,
	abstract = "Common time-explicit numerical methods for kinetic simulations of plasmas in the low-collisions limit fall into two classes of algorithms: momentum conserving (also known as particle-in-cell (PIC)) and energy conserving. Each has certain drawbacks. The PIC algorithm does not conserve total energy, which may lead to spurious numerical heating (grid heating). Its overall accuracy is at most second due to the nature of the force interpolation between grid and particle position. Energy-conserving algorithms do not exhibit grid heating, but because their formulation uses potentials, computationally undesirable matrix inversions may be necessary. In addition, compared to PIC algorithms for the same accuracy, these algorithms have higher numerical noise due to the restricted choice of particle shapes. Here we formulate time-explicit, finite-size particle algorithms using particular reductions of the particle distribution function. These reductions are used in two variational principles, a Lagrangian-based and a Hamiltonian-based in conjunction with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The Lagrangian formulations here generalize previous such formulations. The Hamiltonian formulation is presented here for the first time. Many drawbacks of the two classes of particle methods are mitigated. For example, restrictions on particle shapes are relaxed in energy conserving algorithms, which can decrease the numerical noise in these methods. The Hamiltonian formulation of particle algorithms is done in terms of fields instead of potentials, thus avoiding solving Poisson{\rq}s equation. An algorithm that conserves both energy and momentum is presented. Other features of the algorithms include a natural way to perform coordinate transformations, the use of various time integrating methods, and the ability to increase the overall accuracy beyond second order, including all generalizations. For clarity of presentation, we restrict our discussion to one-dimensional, non-relativistic, unmagnetized, electrostatic plasmas.",

@article{Tronci2010,
	abstract = "The Hamiltonian structures of several hybrid kinetic-fluid models are identified explicitly, upon considering collisionless Vlasov dynamics for the hot particles interacting with a bulk fluid. After presenting different pressure-coupling schemes for an ordinary fluid interacting with a hot gas, the paper extends the treatment to account for a fluid plasma interacting with an energetic ion species. Both current-coupling and pressure-coupling MHD schemes are treated extensively. In particular, pressure-coupling schemes are shown to require a transport-like term in the Vlasov kinetic equation, in order for the Hamiltonian structure to be preserved. The last part of the paper is devoted to studying the more general case of an energetic ion species interacting with a neutralizing electron background (hybrid Hall-MHD). Circulation laws and Casimir functionals are presented explicitly in each case.",

@article{Xiao2018,
	abstract = "Recent development of structure-preserving geometric particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms for Vlasov-Maxwell systems is summarized. With the arrival of 100 petaflop and exaflop computing power, it is now possible to carry out direct simulations of multi-scale plasma dynamics based on first-principles. However, standard algorithms currently adopted by the plasma physics community do not possess the long-term accuracy and fidelity required for these large-scale simulations. This is because conventional simulation algorithms are based on numerically solving the underpinning differential (or integro-differential) equations, and the algorithms used in general do not preserve the geometric and physical structures of the systems, such as the local energy-momentum conservation law, the symplectic structure, and the gauge symmetry. As a consequence, numerical errors accumulate coherently with time and long-term simulation results are not reliable. To overcome this difficulty and to harness the power of exascale computers, a new generation of structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithms have been developed. This new generation of algorithms utilizes modern mathematical techniques, such as discrete manifolds, interpolating differential forms, and non-canonical symplectic integrators, to ensure gauge symmetry, space-time symmetry and the conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and the symplectic structure. These highly desired properties are difficult to achieve using the conventional PIC algorithms. In addition to summarizing the recent development and demonstrating practical implementations, several new results are also presented, including a structure-preserving geometric relativistic PIC algorithm, the proof of the correspondence between discrete gauge symmetry and discrete charge conservation law, and a reformulation of the explicit non-canonical symplectic algorithm for the discrete Poisson bracket using the variational approach. Numerical examples are given to verify the advantages of the structure-preserving geometric PIC algorithms in comparison with the conventional PIC methods.",
