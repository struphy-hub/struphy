# STRUPHY - STRUcture-Preserving HYbrid codes

A Python package for energetic particles in plasma.

The package is developed since 2019 at [Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/) 
in the division [NMPP (Numerical Methods for Plasma Physics)](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/de/for/bereiche/numerik).

## What you can do with struphy

* Solve a variety of [plasma physics PDEs](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/models.html) with fluid and/or kinetic components on [curved domains](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/domains.html) 
* [Post process](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/userguide.html#post-processing) data and generate `.vtk` files for 3d views
* Add your own [model equations](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/developers.html#model-equations) or [physics feature](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/sections/developers.html#how-to-add) 

## Algorithmic features

* Particle-in-cell method for kinetic species
* Discrete differential forms based on high-order B-spline finite elements ([Psydac library](https://github.com/pyccel/psydac)) for fields/fluids
* Exact conservation laws
* Polar splines to treat a polar singularity 
* Kernels are pre-compiled with [Pyccel](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel) to achieve near-Fortran performance
* MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallelization  

## Installation

* See the [struphy documentation](https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/index.html).

## Tutorials

* [Turorial 01](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/struphy/struphy/-/blob/devel/notebooks/tutorial_01_units_run_main.ipynb>`): Learn about Struphy model's normalization (units), simulation parameters and the Struphy main execution file.

* [Tutorial 02](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/struphy/struphy/-/blob/devel/notebooks/tutorial_02_postproc_standard_plotting.ipynb): Learn about the data generated by Struphy simulations, data post processing and simple plotting 
of field/fluid and kinetic variables.

* [Tutorial 03](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/struphy/struphy/-/blob/devel/notebooks/tutorial_03_plot_poloidal_planes.ipynb): Learn about plotting field/fluid variables in toroidal geometry.
