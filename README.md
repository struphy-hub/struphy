# Welcome to Hylife repo!

*The Python Finite Element library for structure-preserving fluid-kinetic hybrid simulations.*

Currently, there is 1 code delivered with the Hylife repository:

- STRUPHY_3D (STRUcture-Preserving HYbrid code for MHD-kinetic current coupling)

# Requirements

* Linux or MacOS

* Working gfortran compiler
```
sudo apt install gfortran
```

* Python3: is standard in most newer Linux distributions, otherwise found at [python.org](https://python.org)

* Necessary Python packages can be installed with
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This performs essentially
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install mpi4py
pip3 install h5py
pip3 install PyYAML
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install matplotlib
python3 -m pip install pyccel==0.10.1
```

* In case there are problems with the installation of mpi4py type
```
sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev
```
<!---
## Installing Pyccel

In order to be able to execute `pyccel` globally you need to add its path to your `$PATH` variable:

```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```

If you want to add the path permanently, add the above line to your `.bashrc` file in `$HOME`.
In order to test the installation go to an arbitrary directory and type `pyccel --version`. You should see something like

```
pyccel 0.9.16 from ...your_pyccel_location.../pyccel/pyccel (python 3.8)
```
-->

Specifics for the HPC system `cobra` at IPP:

- use the module `anaconda/3/2020.02` for installing pyccel and loading mpi4py.



# Installing Hylife
```
git clone https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/clapp/hylife.git
```

# Setting up STRUPHY

In order to get the STRUPHY code (at the moment only `STUPHY_cc_lin_6D.py`) running perform the following steps:

1. In your `Hylife` repository execute
  ```
  ./STRUPHY_init.sh
  ```
  This copies the main code `STRUPHY_cc_lin_6D.py` and an execution script `run_STRUPHY_cc_lin_6D.sh` to your repository.

2. Create a folder `my_output` for STRUPHY output. Output of specific simulations e.g. `sim_1`, `sim_2`, etc. will be stored in `my_output/sim_1`, `my_output/sim_2`, etc..
  
3. In your `Hylife` repository execute
  ```
  cp -r simulations/template_python path_to_my_output/sim_1
  ```
  This copies a simulation template from your `Hylife` repository to your simulation folder `sim_1`.
  
4. In your `Hylife` repository, in the file `run_STRUPHY_cc_lin_6D.sh` set the correct paths in lines 5 and 6
  ```
  all_sim=path_to_my_output
  run_dir=sim_1
  ```
  
5. In your `Hylife` repository run STRUPHY with
  ```
  ./run_STRUPHY_cc_lin_6D.sh
  ```
  This will create some output stored in `path_to_myoutput/sim_1/results_sim_1.hdf5´.
